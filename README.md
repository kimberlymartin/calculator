# Calculator with Accessibility Feature

This calculator was made by me and a few classmates. The calculator performs basic algorithmic functions, but what's special about it is the ability to be used without any clicking. For people with poor motor control, they can simply hover their mouse over the button for a short amount of time and the button will be "clicked". This is indicated by a gradual change of button color which resets when the button has successfully been pressed. The hover time for a "click" is set to 2 seconds.
